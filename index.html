					This histogram shows the distribution of profits from house flipping in Boston after removing some extreme outliers. Most flips result in moderate profits, with a median profit of $89,145 and average profit of $314,150 across the years. This means that some very profitable flips skewed the distribution.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Key Insights:
				1.	House flipping is highly concentrated in high-end neighbourhoods like South End and Back Bay, while lower-income areas see significantly fewer flips.
				2.	Larger investors take on higher risk but have greater profit potential, while smaller investors and non-investors engage in more stable investments.
				3.	Multi-family residences (2RF, R3F) provide the most stable profits, whereas commercial properties have high but unpredictable returns.
				4.	Market trends suggest that external factors may have played a role in major profit spikes (2000, 2006, 2020) and dips (2010).

				Overall, the market for flipped properties stayed relatively stable during the 2000-2024 period in Boston. Further analysis could explore how economic shifts, interest rates, and zoning laws have influenced flipping trends over time.
