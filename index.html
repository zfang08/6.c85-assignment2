					•	Mean Profit: $314,150
					•	Median Profit: $89,145
					•	Max Profit: $8,241,916
					•	Min Profit: -$2,223,750
					•	Standard Deviation: $968,394

					This histogram shows the distribution of profits from house flipping in Boston after removing some extreme outliers. Most flips result in moderate profits, with a median profit of $89,145 and average profit of $314,150 across the years. This means that some very profitable flips skewed the distribution. The standard deviation is also very high, meaning that there is considerable variability in the profit in Boston.

					•	Mean Profit: 32.41%
					•	Median Profit: 11.88%
					•	Max Profit: 1087.20%
					•	Min Profit: -79.43%
					•	Standard Deviation: 99.14%
					This Histogram shows that while the average profit percentage is around 32%, the median is much lower at 11.88%. This supports the phenomenon in the previous plot, that some extremely profitable flips are pulling up the mean. The high standard deviation shows that returns on flipping houses can be unpredictable.

					This is a line chart showing the median and mean house flipping profits in Boston over the years. We can see that the median and mean stayed relatively stable from 2000 to 2020, with mean profit being always slightly higher than the median. This supports the previous conclusion that the extremely profitable flips are pulling the mean upward. Additionally, in2000, 2006 and 2020, there are extreme spikes of mean profit, indicating that many of these highly profitable flips happened during these two years. In 2010, there is a noticeable dip in both the median and mean profit. So, it would be interesting to look at in later questions what happened during the year 2006, 2010, and 2020 to give more context to these extreme patterns.

					By looking at the histogram, we can conclude that roughly 1300 out of 1704 total flips between the year 2000 and 2024 are within the 2116, 2118, 2114, 2115, and 2111 zip code area. These zip codes correspond to popular neighbourhoods such as South End, Back Bay, and Beacon Hill, which are more likely to be flipped because of historical properties and their popularity. We can see that investors target these areas which are known for high-end condos and townhouses, which are lucrative in the short term. But I would also caution against this reading as there are 24 zip codes out of 38 that have no recorded flips at all. This suggests potential missing data or reporting of flips in certain areas.

					Furthermore, while we see all the flips concentrated in the Back Bay, South End and Beacon Hill, other residential areas like Mattapan and Dorchester show much lower number of flips. This could be due to lower investment returns and fewer potential speculative buyers.

					According to the histogram, we can see that the non-investor is the most common invester-type for both selling and buying flipped properties. This is followed by small investors. This indicates that the buying and selling flipped properties is more suited to small investors or for independent investors. We will look at the relationships between investor type and property type to further understand the tendencies of each type of investors.

					In this heatmap, we can observe distinct investment preferences among different types of investors. Non-investors and small investors favor Residential Condominiums (RCD) as their primary property type. Additionally, non-investors also show interest in Single-Family Residences (R1F), which suggests that they are primarily purchasing homes for personal use, likely due to limited capital.

					On the other hand, larger investors have a more diversified portfolio. While they do invest in RCDs, they also purchase COM and Apartment Buildings (APT). This indicates that larger investors tend to focus on properties that generate long-term rental income.

					Based on the histogram, we can see that the Institutional and large investors have much higher average profit with institutional having an average of roughly $20 Million, and large investors of $2.5 Million. However, when we look at the distribution of the profit, we can see that the extreme profit of institutional projects is pulled up by many extreme outliers. Small, Medium and Large Investors have the higher median profit, while institutional and non-investors have median profit of around $100-125K. Overall, we can see that larger investors have a wider spread (higher risk), but they have higher profit.

					Based on the histogram and box plot, when outliers are included, we see commercial types and exempt type properties are two of the most profitable. But when we exclude these extreme outliers, 2 family residence and 3 family residence have higher median profit comparing the the rest of the property type. This means that high-value commercial transactions can generate high profits, multi-family residential properties (2RF R3F) offer more consistent and stable returns, making them attractive for investors looking for reliable rental income.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Key Insights:
				1.	House flipping is highly concentrated in high-end neighbourhoods like South End and Back Bay, while lower-income areas see significantly fewer flips.
				2.	Larger investors take on higher risk but have greater profit potential, while smaller investors and non-investors engage in more stable investments.
				3.	Multi-family residences (2RF, R3F) provide the most stable profits, whereas commercial properties have high but unpredictable returns.
				4.	Market trends suggest that external factors may have played a role in major profit spikes (2000, 2006, 2020) and dips (2010).

				Overall, the market for flipped properties stayed relatively stable during the 2000-2024 period in Boston. Further analysis could explore how economic shifts, interest rates, and zoning laws have influenced flipping trends over time.
